abstract = {Although invasive species can have substantial impacts on animal communities, cases of invasive species facilitating native species by removing their predators have rarely been demonstrated across vertebrate trophic linkages. The predictable spread of the invasive cane toad (Rhinella marina), however, offered a unique opportunity to quantify cascading effects. In northern Australia, three species of predatory monitor lizards suffered severe population declines due to toad-induced lethal toxic ingestion (yellow-spotted monitor [Varanus panoptes], Mertens' water monitor [V. mertensi], Mitchell's water monitor [V. mitchelli]). We, thus, predicted subsequent increases in the abundance and recruitment of prey species due to the reduction of those predators. Toad-induced population-level declines in the water monitor species approached 50\% over a five-year period spanning the toad invasion, apparently causing fledging success of the Crimson Finch (Neochmia phaeton) to increase from 55\% to 81\%. The consensus of our original and published long-term data is that invasive cane toads are causing predators to lose a foothold on top-down regulation of their prey, triggering shifts in the relative densities of predator and prey in the Australian tropical savannah ecosystem.},

abstract = {In inverted biomass pyramids (IBPs) prey are outnumbered by their predators when measured by biomass. We investigate how prey should behave in the face of danger from higher predator biomass, and how anti-predator behavior (in the form of vigilance) can, in turn, affect the predator–prey system. In this study, we incorporate anti-predator behaviors into a Lotka–Volterra predator–prey model in the form of fixed and facultative vigilance. Facultative vigilance models behavior as a dynamic foraging game, allowing us to assess optimal behavioral responses in the context of IBPs using a dynamical fitness optimization approach. We model vigilance as a tradeoff between safety and either the prey's maximum growth rate or its carrying capacity. We assess the population dynamics of predators and prey with fear responses, and investigate the role fear plays on trophic structure. We found that the ecology of fear plays an important role in predator–prey systems, impacting trophic structure and the occurrence of IBPs. Fixed vigilance works against IBP structure by always reducing the predator–prey biomass ratio at equilibrium with increasing levels of vigilance. Facultative vigilance can actually promote IBPs, as prey can now adjust their vigilance levels to cope with increased predation and the costs associated with vigilance. This is especially true when the effectiveness of vigilance is low and predators are very lethal. In general, these trends are true whether the costs of vigilance are felt on the prey's maximum growth rate or its carrying capacity. Just as the ecology of fear, when first introduced, was used to explain why top carnivores are rare in terrestrial systems, it can also be used to understand how big fierce predators can be common in IBPs.},

    abstract = {1. Introduced predators account for a large part of the extinction of endemic insular species, which constitutes a major component of the loss of biodiversity among vertebrates. Eradication of alien predators from these ecosystems is often considered the best solution. 2. In some ecosystems, however, it can generate a greater threat for endemic prey through what is called the ‘mesopredator release’. This process predicts that, once superpredators are suppressed, a burst of mesopredators may follow which leads their shared prey to extinction. 3. This process is studied through a mathematical model describing a three species system (prey–mesopredator–superpredator). Analysis of the model, with and without control of meso- and superpredators, shows that this process does indeed exist and can drive shared prey to rapid extinction. 4. This work emphasizes that, although counter-intuitive, eradication of introduced superpredators, such as feral domestic cats, is not always the best solution to protect endemic prey when introduced mesopredators, such as rats, are also present.},

    abstract={In this paper, we revisit the dynamical interaction among prey (bird), mesopredator (rat), and superpredator (cat) discussed in [Courchamp, F., Langlais, M., Sugihara, G., 1999. Cats protecting birds: modelling the mesopredator release effect. Journal of Animal Ecology 68, 282--292]. First, we develop a prey-mesopredator-superpredator (i.e., bird-rat-cat, briefly, BRC) model, where the predator's functional responses are derived based on the classical Holling's time budget arguments. Our BRC model overcomes several model construction problems in Courchamp et al. (1999), and admits richer, reasonable and realistic dynamics. We explore the possible control strategies to save or restore the bird by controlling or eliminating the rat or the cat when the bird is endangered. We establish the existence of two types of mesopredator release phenomena: severe mesopredator release, where once superpredators are suppressed, a burst of mesopredators follows which leads their shared prey to extinction; and mild mesopredator release, where the mesopredator release could assert more negative impact on the endemic prey but does not lead the endemic prey to extinction. A sharp sufficient criterion is established for the occurrence of severe mesopredator release. We also show that, in a prey-mesopredator-superpredator trophic food web, eradication of introduced superpredators such as feral domestic cats in the BRC model, is not always the best solution to protect endemic insular prey. The presence of a superpredator may have a beneficial effect in such systems.},
